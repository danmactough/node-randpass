#  node-randpass - Pseudo-random password generator 

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/danmactough/node-randpass.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
      
This module adds a pseudo-random password generator

Generate a random password. By default, alternates vowels and
consonants, for maximum pronounceability.  Uses its own
list of consonants, which excludes f and c and k to prevent
generating obscene-sounding passwords. Number 1 and
lowercase l are excluded on the basis of looking like
each other. Number 0 is also excluded so as not to be mistaken for
uppercase O. An uppercase letter and symbol are used by default.

## Installation

    npm install randpass

## Examples

```javascript
var randpass = require('randpass');
randpass(); // Generates an 8 character password with alternating vowels and consonants, using
            // the default 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, and 1 symbol
randpass(10); // Generates a 10 character password with alternating vowels and consonants, using
              // the default 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, and 1 symbol
randpass({length: 12, symbols: false, capitals: false, alternate: false}); // Generates a 12 character
                                                                           // password without alternating
                                                                           // vowels and consonants and no
                                                                           // symbols or uppercase letters
```
